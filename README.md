# lib_NRF24L01

This library was developed in the C language to utilize the SPI protocol in order to communicate between two microcontrollers 
over long distances (up to 1km without obstacles) using the NRF24L01 wireless module.

In the example, there is an application aiming to communicate between two PIC18F4550 microcontrollers, where a matrix keypad 
inputs data into the first microcontroller and the information is displayed on an LCD display connected to the second one.

The code was developed and compiled with the assistance of Microchip's MPLAB XC8 software.
